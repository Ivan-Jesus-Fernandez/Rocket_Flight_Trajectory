# Rocket_Flight_Trajectory
The attached MATLAB codes assume a constant thrust and constant mass of the SATURN V rocket. <br>
NASA fires the motors at negative t and lifts off at t = 0. In contrast, the Russians fire the motor at t = 0 and lift 
off at positive t. The attached MATLAB codes utilizes different values of t to launch the SATURN V rocket. (i.e., t = 5, 10, 15, â€¦ and so on).

## Project Requirments:
1. Using the MATLAB program given in RockLaunch.m file as an example, design, build 
and test MATLAB codes which simulate a SATURN V rocket launch, using the constant 
acceleration model. Write a MATLAB script to launch the rocket specifying the initial 
conditions at the beginning of the program so that they can be changed. Modify the function 
GetAccelaration to GetConstAcceleration. The new function will be renamed as 
GetConstAcceleration.m file.

2. Add MatLab codes to plot a graph of the height against time, velocity against time, 
acceleration against time for the SATURN V rocket launch.

3. Modify the plot function to produce three figures of height, velocity and acceleration with 
three subplots command, plotting height in blue and velocity in green and acceleration in 
red colours.

4. Modify the RocketLaunch.m function to RocketLaunchH.m and GetConstAcceleration 
function into GetHAcceleration.m, and modify them to determine the horizontal 
displacement at which the rocket exceeds the speed of sound. Assume that, instead of 
launching vertically, the rocket launched horizontally.

## Grading Criteria:
- <b>Clarity</b>: Does it clearly state what to develop/solve and what has been done? <br>
- <b>Originality</b>:: Is the proposed idea/solution original? <br>
- <b>Approach</b>:: How much are the development process and experiment environment realistic? <br>
- <b>Presentation/Demo</b>: Are the presentation and demo persuasive? <br>
- <b>Report</b>: Are the reports (final report) nicely organized and well presented? <br>
